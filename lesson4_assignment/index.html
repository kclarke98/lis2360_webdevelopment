            <h1> Artificial Intelligence </h1>
            <em> Overview </em>
            
            <p> Intelligence is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills. Humans, and 
            animals have different levels of intelligence. This is called natural intelligence, but there is also a 
            phenomena called artificial intelligence (AI).
            </p>
            
            <p> Most people have mixed perceptions of what artificial intelligence is. The most basic definition of 
            artificial intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines. In the world we live in today artificial
            intelligence is growing more and more prominent.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Artificial intelligence is in our everyday lives too. Google uses AI to ensure that nearly all of the email 
            landing in your inbox is authentic. In addition, AI is used to help match candidates to jobs with the hopes
            of creating better employee-employer matches.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Artificial intelligence is on an international stage, and every country wants the best form of AI. By the end of 2019
            some predict AI will be creating more jobs then it is taking. While 1.8 million jobs will be lost to autonation 
            (manufacturing jobs most likely to be hit), 2.3 million will be created. In 2019 more people will use AI than ever 
            to arrange our calenders, plan our journeys, and order a pizza.
